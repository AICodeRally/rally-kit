# Vibe Code Rally — Rally Kit

> Students design a business and build a working app in 3 hours with AI.
> Zero coding experience required.

---

## What's in the Box

- **Next.js 15** app with 10 pre-built components and 3 shell layouts
- **Claude Code** as the AI coding partner — guided by `CLAUDE.md`
- **9 slash commands** (`/help`, `/rally`, `/build`, `/brainstorm`, `/polish`, `/demo`, `/fix`, `/status`, `/reset`)
- **One-click installer** — double-click `vibe-code-rally.command` on Mac

## Quick Setup (Per Station)

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check | Install |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Node.js 20+ | `node -v` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Claude CLI | `claude --version` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| API Key | `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |

### Mac (Double-Click)

1. Unzip `rally-kit.zip` to Desktop
2. Double-click `vibe-code-rally.command`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts — that's it

### Windows (Double-Click)

1. Unzip `rally-kit.zip` to Desktop
2. Double-click `start.bat`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts — that's it

> **Windows note:** Requires Node.js 20+, Claude CLI, and `curl` (ships with Windows 10+).
> If the `.bat` has trouble, open Command Prompt and run manually:
> ```
> cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\rally-kit
> npm install
> start /min cmd /c "npm run dev"
> claude
> ```

### Manual (Any OS)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/rally-kit    # or wherever you unzipped
npm install
npm run dev &             # start dev server (use 'start /min cmd /c "npm run dev"' on Windows)
claude                    # launch AI coding partner
```

## Security

- Claude is sandboxed — cannot install packages, access the internet, or read files outside the project
- Prompt injection is handled gracefully (warm redirect to building)
- API key is in `.env` (gitignored, never committed)
- All system files are protected from modification
